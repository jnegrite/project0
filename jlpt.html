            <h1>What is the JLPT?</h1>
            <p>
                The Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (日本語能力試験, Nihongo Nōryoku Shiken), or JLPT,
                is a standardized criterion-referenced test to evaluate and certify Japanese language
                proficiency for non-native speakers, covering language knowledge, reading ability,
                and listening ability. The test is held twice a year in Japan and selected countries
                (on the first Sunday of July and December), and once a year in other regions
                (on the first Sunday of December).
            </p>
            <p>
                The JLPT consists of five levels. Until 2009, the test had four levels, with 4 being the
                lowest and 1 being the highest level of certification. JLPT certificates do not expire or become invalid over time.
